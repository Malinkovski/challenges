## Description 
 
Challenge 19 Restaurants, this challenge involves creating a web app about restaurants using React typescript. The data is stored in db.json and accessed by running a local server. The web page features dynamic routes using the react router DOM to navigate through the app, contexts for easier access to the restaurant's types as well as the theme of the website. AJAX is implemented in the reviews section for each restaurant and the favorite restaurants feature works with local storage.
